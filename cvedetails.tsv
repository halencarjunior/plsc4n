1	CVE-2022-23599	79		XSS	2022-01-28	2022-02-04	2.6	None	Remote	High	Not required	None	Partial	None	Products.ATContentTypes are the core content types for Plone 2.1 - 4.3. Versions of Plone that are dependent on Products.ATContentTypes prior to version 3.0.6 are vulnerable to reflected cross site scripting and open redirect when an attacker can get a compromised version of the image_view_fullscreen page in a cache, for example in Varnish. The technique is known as cache poisoning. Any later visitor can get redirected when clicking on a link on this page. Usually only anonymous users are affected, but this depends on the user's cache settings. Version 3.0.6 of Products.ATContentTypes has been released with a fix. This version works on Plone 5.2, Python 2 only. As a workaround, make sure the image_view_fullscreen page is not stored in the cache. More information about the vulnerability and cvmitigation measures is available in the GitHub Security Advisory.

5	CVE-2021-33511	918			2021-05-21	2021-05-24	5.0	None	Remote	Low	Not required	Partial	None	None	Plone though 5.2.4 allows SSRF via the lxml parser. This affects Diazo themes, Dexterity TTW schemas, and modeleditors in plone.app.theming, plone.app.dexterity, and plone.supermodel.
6	CVE-2021-33510	918			2021-05-21	2021-05-24	4.0	None	Remote	Low	???	Partial	None	None	Plone through 5.2.4 allows remote authenticated managers to conduct SSRF attacks via an event ical URL, to read one line of a file.

9	CVE-2021-33507	79		XSS	2021-05-21	2021-05-27	4.3	None	Remote	Medium	Not required	None	Partial	None	Zope Products.CMFCore before 2.5.1 and Products.PluggableAuthService before 2.6.2, as used in Plone through 5.2.4 and other products, allow Reflected XSS.
10	CVE-2021-32806	601			2021-08-02	2021-09-20	5.8	None	Remote	Medium	Not required	Partial	Partial	None	Products.isurlinportal is a replacement for isURLInPortal method in Plone. Versions of Products.isurlinportal prior to 1.2.0 have an Open Redirect vulnerability. Various parts of Plone use the 'is url in portal' check for security, mostly to see if it is safe to redirect to a url. A url like `https://example.org` is not in the portal. The url `https:example.org` without slashes is considered to be in the portal. When redirecting, some browsers go to `https://example.org`, others give an error. Attackers may use this to redirect victims to their site, especially as part of a phishing attack. The problem has been patched in Products.isurlinportal 1.2.0.
11	CVE-2021-32633	22		Dir. Trav.	2021-05-21	2021-07-30	6.5	None	Remote	Low	???	Partial	Partial	Partial	Zope is an open-source web application server. In Zope versions prior to 4.6 and 5.2, users can access untrusted modules indirectly through Python modules that are available for direct use. By default, only users with the Manager role can add or edit Zope Page Templates through the web, but sites that allow untrusted users to add/edit Zope Page Templates through the web are at risk from this vulnerability. The problem has been fixed in Zope 5.2 and 4.6. As a workaround, a site administrator can restrict adding/editing Zope Page Templates through the web using the standard Zope user/role permission mechanisms. Untrusted users should not be assigned the Zope Manager role and adding/editing Zope Page Templates through the web should be restricted to trusted users only.
12	CVE-2021-29002	79		XSS	2021-03-24	2021-12-08	3.5	None	Remote	Medium	???	None	Partial	None	A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Plone CMS 5.2.3 exists in site-controlpanel via the "form.widgets.site_title" parameter.

None	Partial	None	Plone CMS until version 5.2.4 has a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the user fullname property and the file upload functionality. The user's input data is not properly encoded when being echoed back to the user. This data can be interpreted as executable code by the browser and allows an attacker to execute JavaScript in the context of the victim's browser if the victim opens a vulnerable page containing an XSS payload.
14	CVE-2020-35190	306			2020-12-17	2020-12-18	10.0	None	Remote	Low	Not required	Complete	Complete	Complete	The official plone Docker images before version of 4.3.18-alpine (Alpine specific) contain a blank password for a root user.

24	CVE-2017-1000484	601			2018-01-03	2018-01-18	5.8	None	Remote	Medium	Not required	Partial	Partial	None	By linking to a specific url in Plone 2.5-5.1rc1 with a parameter, an attacker could send you to his own website. On its own this is not so bad: the attacker could more easily link directly to his own website instead. But in combination with another attack, you could be sent to the Plone login form and login, then get redirected to the specific url, and then get a second redirect to the attacker website. (The specific url can be seen by inspecting the hotfix code, but we don't want to make it too easy for attackers by spelling it out here.)
25	CVE-2017-1000483				2018-01-03	2019-10-03	4.0	None	Remote	Low	???	Partial	None	None	Accessing private content via str.format in through-the-web templates and scripts in Plone 2.5-5.1rc1. This improves an earlier hotfix. Since the format method was introduced in Python 2.6, this part of the hotfix is only relevant for Plone 4 and 5.
26	CVE-2017-1000482	79		XSS	2018-01-03	2018-01-17	3.5	None	Remote	Medium	???	None	Partial	None	A member of the Plone 2.5-5.1rc1 site could set javascript in the home_page property of his profile, and have this executed when a visitor click the home page link on the author page.
27	CVE-2017-1000481	601			2018-01-03	2018-01-18	5.8	None	Remote	Medium	Not required	Partial	Partial	None	When you visit a page where you need to login, Plone 2.5-5.1rc1 sends you to the login form with a 'came_from' parameter set to the previous url. After you login, you get redirected to the page you tried to view before. An attacker might try to abuse this by letting you click on a specially crafted link. You would login, and get redirected to the site of the attacker, letting you think that you are still on the original Plone site. Or some javascript of the attacker could be executed. Most of these types of attacks are already blocked by Plone, using the `isURLInPortal` check to make sure we only redirect to a page on the same Plone site. But a few more ways of tricking Plone into accepting a malicious link were discovered, and fixed with this hotfix.
